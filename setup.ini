Tl201=Tl-201 myocardial perfusion scan was done with dipyridamole stress. Dipyridamole 0.57mg/kg was IV injected for 5 minutes. Tl-201 2mCi was injected 1 minutes after pharmacological stress. Images were started 5 min and 4 hrs after injection with SPECT. Images were reconstructed with iterative reconstruction technique and displayed in multiple transaxial planes and 3D pictures.
MiBi=Tc-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion scan was done with dipyridamole stress. Dipyridamole 0.57 mg/kg was IV injected for 5 minutes. Tc-99m sestamibi was injected after pharmacological stress and at rest, 10mCi and 25mCi respectively. Images were started 60 min after 1st and 2nd injection with SPECT. Images were reconstructed with iterative reconstruction technique and displayed in multiple transaxial planes and 3D pictures.®æ¦¡
